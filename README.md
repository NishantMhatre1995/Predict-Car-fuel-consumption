# Predict-Car-fuel-consumption
### Problem
The goal of the Auto mpg dataset analysis is to have a good understanding of the variables influencing the overall fuel consumption of each automobile.
vehicles of many kinds and varieties from numerous auto manufacturers with origins in the USA, Japan, and Europe.
Several variables, including the automobile's model year, horsepower, number of cylinders, displacement, weight, and rate of acceleration, have an impact on how much fuel a car uses. To increase the mpg number, we must identify the aspects that influence a car's fuel usage the most.
Create a model to forecast each car's mpg number.


## Features on data set

**cylinders:** contains the number of cylinders present in the car

**displacement:** contains the Displacement of the car

**horsepower:** contains the Horsepower of the car

**weight:** contains the weight of the car

**acceleration:** contains the Acceleration of the car

**model_year:** contains the model year of the car

**origin:** contains the origin country which car belong to

**car_name:** contains the name of the car(Brand-Model-Variant)

## Target Variable 

**mpg:** contains the fuel consumption value(in Miles per Gallon) for car
 
## Learning
Most of the time we use L2 regularization but from the analysis we get to know that we have lots of non useful features then L1 regularization will be good option to go. This will also help in remove features thus improving efficency of the algorithm.
